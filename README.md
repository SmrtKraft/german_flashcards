Flashcards For Learning German


This program will show you a German word and after 3 seconds it will show you its English translation. 

When you select '''don't know this word''' the program will save that word in order to show it to you again and again till you learn it and when you select
'''Ja!, I know this one''' it will remove it from the list of words reducing thus the total number of words to memorize.

If you want to reset the flashcards as to include the previous deleted ones, just click on '''Delete Saved Words'''.
